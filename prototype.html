        <h1>Hi-Fi Prototype</h1>
        <h4>Feedback on Wireframes</h4>

        <p class="fade-in paragraph">
          We met with our intermediary contact as well as our Partiful point of
          contact, who gave us some feedback:
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul class="fade-in paragraph">
          <li>The when2meet aspect may be overwhelming for simple hangouts.</li>
          <li>Having the calendar on the home page may be too busy.</li>
          <li>
            The homepage may have too much content; may feel too busy or
            condensed.
          </li>
          <li>
            It may be too formal for the user to still be designated as a “host”
            for a casual hangout.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <br />

        <p class="fade-in paragraph">
          After receiving feedback from our point of contact, we focused on the
          following changes:
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul class="fade-in paragraph">
          <li>
            Simplifying the user flow, especially the home page, by limiting the
            different sections on screen to the most important ones, and
            shrinking the Party Genie.
          </li>
          <li>
            Simplifying calendar functionality so it’s more intuitive what the
            user needs to press.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="fade-in paragraph">
          We decided to continue with the design that had the hangout on the
          homescreen, as we felt that this reflected Partiful’s design goals in
          making a casual option that is more discoverable. We moved onto
          creating a high-fidelity prototype using Figma, which you can find
          below, along with our Loom walkthrough video.
        </p>

        <p class="fade-in paragraph">
          We then met with our Partiful point of contact for a final critique.
          In terms of the feedback we received:
        </p>
        <br />

        <ul class="fade-in paragraph">
          <li>
            The time picker may still be overwhelming for some users, and it’s
            unknown how intuitive the design is.
          </li>
          <li>
            We should check how the yes/no/maybe colored icons appear with a
            variety of profile photos, including the default grey one, in case
            it’s overwhelming.
          </li>
          <li>
            For yes/no/maybe functionality, it may be nice to have a “I’m down”
            option that feels more casual.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="fade-in paragraph">
          We appreciated the feedback we received, and found a lot of this
          applicable; on a future iteration, we would want to incorporate the
          simplified “I’m down” option, and test the accept/reject icons on a
          variety of profile photos. In addition, we’d like to conduct some user
          testing for the intuitivity of the homescreen hangout functionality.
