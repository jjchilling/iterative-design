            <h4>Feedback on Wireframes</h4>

            <p class="fade-in paragraph">
                We met with our intermediary contact as well as our Partiful point of contact, who gave us some feedback:
            </p>
            <br>
            <ul class="fade-in paragraph">
                <li>The when2meet aspect may be overwhelming for simple hangouts.</li>
                <li>Having the calendar on the home page may be too busy.</li>
                <li>The homepage may have too much content; may feel too busy or condensed.</li>
                <li>It may be too formal for the user to still be designated as a “host” for a casual hangout.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>

            <p class="fade-in paragraph">
                After receiving feedback from our point of contact, we focused on the following changes: 
            </p>
            <br>
            <ul class="fade-in paragraph">
                <li>Simplifying the user flow, especially the home page, by limiting the different sections on screen to the most important ones, and shrinking the Party Genie.</li>
                <li>Simplifying calendar functionality so it’s more intuitive what the user needs to press.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="fade-in paragraph">
                
                We decided to continue with the design that had the hangout on the homescreen, as we felt that this reflected Partiful’s design goals in making a casual option that is more discoverable.

                We moved onto creating a high-fidelity prototype using Figma, which you can find below, along with our Loom walkthrough video.

            </p>

            <p class="fade-in paragraph">
                We then met with our Partiful point of contact for a final critique. In terms of the feedback we received:
            </p>
            <br>
            
            <ul class="fade-in paragraph">
                <li>The time picker may still be overwhelming for some users, and it’s unknown how intuitive the design is.</li>
                <li>We should check how the yes/no/maybe colored icons appear with a variety of profile photos, including the default grey one, in case it’s overwhelming.</li>
                <li>For yes/no/maybe functionality, it may be nice to have a “I’m down” option that feels more casual.</li> 
            </ul>

            <p class="fade-in paragraph">
               
                We appreciated the feedback we received, and found a lot of this applicable; on a future iteration, we would want to incorporate the simplified “I’m down” option, and test the accept/reject icons on a variety of profile photos. In addition, we’d like to conduct some user testing for the intuitivity of the homescreen hangout functionality.
