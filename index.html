            <p class="fade-in paragraph">The following page will be displaying our iterative work in a collaborative project with Partiful. Our goal was to address Partiful's concern of their event creation process being too formal for simple hangouts. We sought to create a new workflow that would allow users to plan hangouts in a swifter and simpler manner. Through several critique sessions with Partiful, we created several sketches, wireframes, and responsive mockups that allowed us to hone our ideas into a final design that fulfilled Partifulâ€™s and our goals.
